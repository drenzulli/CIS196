What I did: 
Tried following the slides.  Ended up in office hours... thanks heroku. =)


And any issues you had and how you solved them:

I had a whole bunch of issues initially getting rails installed.  I got that up and running on Ubuntu 13.04 by installing an additional version of Ruby (1.9.1 -Dev).  This worked great until I got to heroku, which got confused by the many versions of Ruby I had installed.  Finally, I went in for office hours and we completely uninstalled everything, then re-installed all of it through an RVM.  Voila! Problem solved.
